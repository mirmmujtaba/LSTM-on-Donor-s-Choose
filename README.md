# LSTM-on-Donor-s-Choose
DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of
funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before itâ€™s approved
to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website. The goal of this project is to predict whether or not a
DonorsChoose.org project proposal submitted by a teacher will be approved or not.
